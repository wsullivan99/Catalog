# Catalog
Catalog maintains an ArrayList of CatalogItem objects.

The Catalog class should be capable of storing up 
to 100 CatalogItem objects in its list.   However, at any 
given time, there is likely less than 100 CatalogItem objects.  

   The CatalogItem class defines a single item in a storage catalog
   of items available for purchase.  Each item has an integer itemID, 
   which identifies the item, a description, and a price value.  All 
   fields should be private, with accessor methods defined.  The 
   description and price fields should also define mutator methods.  
   Provide a default constructor which sets the fields to a default 
   value, an overloaded constructor which accepts values for all three 
   fields and a copy constructor which creates a new object which is a 
   copy of the parameter object.  A toString method should be defined 
   to return the itemID, description, and price,formatted in currency, 
   as a single descriptive string.  An equals method should be included.  
   Two CatalogItem objects are considered equal when their three field 
   values are the same.
   
This is a simple and straightforward program created late 2019 with the goal to 
become more familiar with data types and object oriented programming. 

Includes a tester class.
